## How to Make a Tutorial

*By Kirstin Petersen, August 8th 2017*

We'd love for more inputs to improve the website. The goal is to eventually have so much information online that students with any background could do well in the class.

Making a tutorial is also a good way to catch up on credits if you are falling behind in class. *Please contact the instructor and agree on a suitable tutorial before beginning!*

### Quick tips for making tutorials

* Tutorials can be either a manual on how to do something (use a program or a design technique), or a walk-through example of how to do it. We are especially looking for good ideas for the latter.
* Tutorials should be kept short and to the point - no one wants to read a lengthy document.
* Tutorials should include lots of helpful pictures. If possible, video tutorials are even better!
* Tutorials shouldn't just include strategies that work, but also comments on what doesn't work.
* Tutorials must start with the name of the class (# ECE3400 Fall year), the title of the tutorial (## title), and the date and contact information of who made the tutorial (*name, date*).
* Don't do double work! Google the topic, if a good tutorial already exist, link to it instead. If you want to improve an existing tutorial that can be arranged too.
