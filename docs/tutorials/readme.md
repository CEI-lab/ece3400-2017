## Tutorials and Helpful links

We have and will continue to upload helpful tutorials and links on this webpage. We would love for you to contribute, please contact the TA's to do this!

**Solutions**

[Team Alpha Repository](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE3400-2017-teamAlpha/)

This is the repository for the team of TA's that solved all the labs during the Summer of 2017. Please use this website for support and inspiration; no credits will be given for close copies of these solutions. Also, the TA's were under strict timelines - hopefully you will upload more comprehensive and better websites over the course of the semester.

**Making Tutorials**

* Making tutorials is a great way to earn extra credit. Please confer with the professor before starting. [Here's a brief tutorial on making tutorials](./tutorials.md), with a list of possible tutorials we'd like to add.
* Also, here is a fantastic [tutorial from Stanford on how to make interactive tutorials](http://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/line-drawing/)

**Related to Control**

* [Intro to Arduino IDE](./Arduino/Arduino_Intro.md)
* Hate the Arduino IDE? You're not alone. It was really made for beginners, and so often hinders more advanced developers. If you are willing to spend some extra hours getting up to speed, you may want to switch to the [Bare-Arduino-Project](https://github.com/ladislas/Bare-Arduino-Project). Be aware that there might be little help from the TAs if you choose this option.
* [Arduino Uno online references and tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)
* [A useful script to report on the internal state of your Arduino](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ShowInfo) and [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ShowInfo?action=sourceblock&num=1)
* Also, for problems with Arduino, look at wiring.c on your development machine to see the firmware settings that are being uploaded to your Arduino.
* [Discussion of Source Code Compilation](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Build-Process).
* [Intro to PWM (Lab1)](./PWM/PWM.md)
* [A Polulu library reference guide for line following](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19/3). We will not be using the same line sensors, so the library won’t be installed/used directly. However, reading through the example will give you an idea of how PID control can be used for line following, particularly the command reference for readLine() and the bottom section on PID control.

**Related to Mechanical Fabrication:**

For the first time ever, we have a Skunkworks available to the class complete with a laser cutter, two 3D printers, and a PCB etching station (to come). This is located in PH414. Please be aware that only TA's (and potentially trained students) will have access to this lab, but everyone can request to have pieces 3D printed, laser cut, or etched in there.

* Solidworks is available in many of the Phillips Hall computer labs; it is very fast to learn, and the tutorials offered in the help-menu are very intuitive.
* [Tutorials on Autocad](./Autocad/AutoCAD_Tutorial.md). Autocad is installed on all the machines in PH427.
