# Class Burn-List

## ECE 3400, Fall 2017, Cornell University

Keeping a burn list is a good practice to keep yourself from getting 'burned' on future revisions: see [Sample Burn List] (https://volersystems.com/v-2010/91-pcb-layout-checklist/) for suggestions, while we are compiling our own list this semester.

* Make tracks width as big as possible. Smaller tracks are fragile, and tend to rip up more easily when soldered to. 
* Always check the minimum spacing between tracks (6mils for 4PCB). 
* Never do right-angle corners on tracks - they tend to break.
* Check for a common ground amoungst all your components.
* Add team name and revision number on top layer copper.
* Make sure power/ground planes have test points
* Dont connect jumper pins together with a trace on the board.
* Make sure RX/TX pins are swapped.
* Make sure there is physical (3D) clearence for the components- especially things like potentiometers that need to be adjusted. 
* No high voltage lines near signal traces.
* If you have multiple IC's (mux, op amp, etc.) then label them- its easy to get them confused when assembling.
