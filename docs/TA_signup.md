# TA sign-up sheets
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017


All TA's must sign up to attend one of the weekly lab hours - we need two TA's for every lab:

* Monday 1.25-4.25pm (Chris)
* Monday 7.30-10pm (Ryan)
* Wednesday 7.30-10pm (Ryan)(Chris)
* Thursday 7.30-10pm -- fyi, this time is tentative, there's still no students signed up for this one.
* Friday 1.25-4.25pm

They must also sign up to grade at least one of the lab's (website), and one of the milestones:

* Lab 1 (Chris)
* Lab 2 (Ryan)
* Lab 3 (Claire)
* Lab 4 (name)
* Milestone 1 (Claire)
* Milestone 2 (Ryan)
* Milestone 3 (Chris)
* Milestone 4 (name)

Everyone needs to help grade the final website in December, and everyone should be present during the final competition December 1st.

Every TA must also organize and teach one of the lectures - you decide whether you prefer a Monday/Wednesday fundamentals, or a Friday lecture which will be more practically oriented. Please refer to the class schedule on the main page to pick a topic.

* FPGA, Friday lecture (Claire)
* Wireless, Monday lecture(?) (Ryan)
* Sensors and Filters, Friday lecture (Chris)
* etc.
