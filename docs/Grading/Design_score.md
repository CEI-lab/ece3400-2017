# Grading of System Design and Documentation
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

_The TA's will award up to 25 points for good system design._

All members on a team will not necessarily be awarded the same number of points.

To earn these points you can for example implement electronic circuits that improve the accuracy of the maze mapping, efficient search strategies, nice FPGA implementation and a great screen display, or new mechanical components to make the robot faster or easier to maintain. If you have tons of spare time, consider using two cooperative robots to map the maze. The sky's the limit!

_The TA's will also award up to 20 points for good website design and documentation._

This will especially pertain to the work done after the labs towards the milestones and the final system design. Examples of things they will assess include:

* Good introductions and problem motivations
* Clarity and thoroughness of documentation
* Intuitive and nice layouts
* Use of the right tools for analysis and unit testing
* Presence of schematics when applicable
* Presence of simulation results when applicable
* Presence and evaluation of experimental results
* Use of graphs and tables to display results, as well as proper axis and unit labeling
* Presence of design flaws
* Comparative discussion of simulation and experimental results
* Presence of conclusions
* Presence of suggestions for future work/improvements
* You can also gain extra points by making good general tutorials for students in future semesters to use. These tutorials may for instance include ways to implement PID control, in-depth tutorials on ATmega timers, new ways to make 3D parts, etc.
