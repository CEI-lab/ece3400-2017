# Grading of Team Work 
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

_15 points will be given through self-assessment within the team._

Twice over the semester we will practice giving and receiving constructive criticism. The point is not to complain, but to make sure everyone contributes their best towards the final project. Each student will be asked to distribute 100 points between their team members dependent on their contribution to the team work. The accumulated points will be normalized to the group size and scaled to between 0 and 15 points towards the final grade.

Each team will send the evaluations using this [form](../Teamwork/GroupProcess-QualitativePeerSelfEval.docx) to the professor and discuss the reasoning for their point distribution. Remember that many qualities can be considered a valuable contribution to a team: technical strength, dedication/persistence, optimism, creativity, leadership and maintaining a perspective, role of initiation, and detail oriented thinking.
