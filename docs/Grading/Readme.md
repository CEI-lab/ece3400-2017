# ECE3400 Semester Grades

The final semester grade will depend on multiple factors including lab solutions, milestones, how well you do in the final competition, websites, team work, and an ethics HW. The details can be found below. Be aware that the standard Cornell rules of [ethical conduct](https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/policy/vol4_6.pdf) apply, and that you may fail the class if you miss more than 2 mandatory meetings, or if we find that you have copied code from other teams and/or online.

A total of 210 points will be given, these correspond to the following grades. *BE AWARE that the grading system is new, and that we may end up rescaling the spectrum during the semester.*
