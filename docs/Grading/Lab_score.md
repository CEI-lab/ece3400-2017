# Grading of Labs
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

The labs are scored by the TA's Friday on the week after the labs are done. Up to 15 points are given for good solutions, 5 points for clear and comprehensive documentation.

**Delayed solutions will receive 0 score, without exception.** 

In lab 1, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Blinking an internal LED
* 2 points: Blinking an external LED
* 2 points: Reading the value of a potentiometer via the serial port
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the LED
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo
* 2 points: Assemble your robot
* 3 points: Driving your robot autonomously

In lab 2, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Correct FFT analysis
* 2 points: Working amplifier circuit
* 3 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone (from tones at 585Hz and 735Hz)
* 2 points: Working IR sensor circuit
* 3 points: Detect a treasure blinking at 7kHz
* 3 points: Nicely merged code

In lab 3, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 1 point: Reading external inputs from Arduino to FPGA
* 1 point: Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs
* 1 point: Drawing one box on the screen
* 1 point: Description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen.
* 4 points: Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen
* 1 point: Connecting the FPGA output to the speaker
* 2 points: Outputting a square wave to the speaker
* 4 points: Outputting a tune of at least three different frequencies to the speaker via an 8-bit DAC

In lab 4, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Sending information wirelessly between Arduino's
* 2 points: Sending the entire maze wirelessly
* 3 points: Updating the maze array, dependent only on the updated robot information
* 1 point: Displaying a full 4-by-5 grid array on the screen
* 3 points: Communicating maze information from the Arduino to the FPGA
* 2 points: Display the robot location on the screen
* 2 points: Distinguish what sites have been visited and which haven't on the screen
