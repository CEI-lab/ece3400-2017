WEBSITE:
I am always looking for motivated undergrads to join my lab. You must be enthusiastic about research, creative, and committed to long-term projects. If you are interested, please write me a brief email about your interests. Be sure to attach your CV, and emphasize experience in practical implementation of robotics, mechatronics, electronics, algorithms, rapid prototyping, vision and tracking, and/or field work with biological systems.
